# DEP Internship -  Project Overview

## Introduction
This repository contains the work completed during my one-month internship at DEP. The internship focused on implementing various systems and tools in C++.

## Tasks Overview
During the internship, I worked on four main tasks:

### Task 1: Historical Weather Data
- **Objective**: Implement a `HistoricalWeatherSystem` class to fetch historical weather data from an API.
- **Description**: 
  - Developed functionality to fetch and display historical weather data.
  - Extended the class to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing the data.
- **Technologies Used**: C++, APIs
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented a system that retrieves and displays historical weather data.

### Task 2: Creating a Contact Management System
- **Objective**: Implement a simple system to manage contacts.
- **Description**: 
  - Developed a C++ program allowing users to add, view, and delete contacts, each with a name and phone number.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Defined a `Contact` class with appropriate attributes.
  - Used vectors to store contact objects.
  - Implemented functions for adding, viewing, and deleting contacts.
  - Provided a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- **Technologies Used**: C++
- **Outcome**: Created a functional contact management system that meets user requirements.

### Task 3: Implementing a Simple File Compression Algorithm
- **Objective**: Develop a basic file compression and decompression tool.
- **Description**: 
  - Created a C++ program that reads a file, compresses its content using Run-Length Encoding, and writes the compressed data to a new file. 
  - Implemented decompression functionality.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Read and write files.
  - Implemented the Run-Length Encoding algorithm.
  - Handled edge cases (e.g., different file types, empty files).
  - Created functions for both compression and decompression.
- **Technologies Used**: C++
- **Outcome**: Successfully developed a tool for compressing and decompressing files.

### Task 4: Building a Multi-Threaded Web Server
- **Objective**: Develop a basic web server that simultaneously handles multiple client requests.
- **Description**: 
  - Created a C++ program that listens for HTTP requests and serves static HTML files.
  - Used multi-threading to handle multiple clients concurrently.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Set up socket programming to handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - Implemented multi-threading using the C++ Standard Library's thread support.
  - Served static HTML files from a specified directory.
  - Handled concurrent client connections.
- **Technologies Used**: C++, Socket Programming
- **Outcome**: Developed a multi-threaded web server capable of handling multiple requests.

## Conclusion
This internship provided valuable experience in enhancing my skills in C++. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with DEP and look forward to applying what I learned in future projects.
